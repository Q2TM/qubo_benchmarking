# Traveling Salesman Problem
The TSP on the nodes of a graph asks for the shortest Hamiltonian cycle that can be taken through each of the nodes. A Hamilton cycle is a closed path that uses every vertex of a graph once. The general solution is unknown and an algorithm that finds it efficiently (e.g., in polynomial time) is not expected to exist.
